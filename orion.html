		<h1 class="display-3">The Orion Project</h1>
		
		<p class="lead">Project Orion was a U.S research project that was operated from 1958 to 1965. Its goal was to research and develop ways of using small nuclear devices as a means
		of propulsion. Supporters of the program believed it would allow for faster and better space travel allowing humanity to become an interplanetary species.</p>
	</div>
	<p>The project began with the use of high explosives to test the concept. A test capsule was suspended with wires underneath a steel tower. The explosives would be placed under the capsule and detonated sequentially.
	With each detonation the explosive forces would push the capsule upwards. </p>
	<h3>The project developed two designs for use with nuclear devices:</h3>
	<div class="card-deck">
		<div class="card">
			<h3 class="card-header">Internal</h3>
			<p class="card-text">
			Internal detonation was designed in a way such that at the rear of the craft would be a pressurised container connected to a supply of nuclear devices.
			The devices would be situated in the centre of this container and it would be filled with a propellant. The nuclear device would then be detonated causing the propellant to expand 
			out of a funnel at the rear of the capsule thus providing thrust to the craft. The container would be refilled with propellant and a new bomb placed in the centre to repeat the process.</p>
			<p class="card-text">This design would prove more troubling to design than the other as it was more complex and would have to be more rugged. The walls of the container would have to be strong
			enough to contain the nuclear blast as well as the force of the propellant being forced out. 
			The device also would have required propellant as well as ways to cool the container. The designs main disadvantage was that it would have been heavier than an external detonation design.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<h3 class="card-header">External</h3>
			<p class="card-text">
			External detonation works by detonating the device behind the craft and a pusher plate at the aft of the craft would absorb the shock of the explosion. The craft would experience near constant
			acceleration due to a smoothening device between it and the pusher plate.  
			The plate would return to a normal position before another device was detonated.</p>
			<p class="card-text">This design unlike the internal design does not contain the explosion meaning that it did not have the material requirement of the internal design.
			It would however contain more moving parts than the internal device due to the pusher plate and cushioning device which means they would have to be engineered to be very rugged.</p>

	<h3>So why use nukes instead of rockets?</h3>
	<p>Project Orion had a massive advantage over normal methods in that it gave a lot more thrust per mass compared to chemical rockets. This meant it could have been used to send far larger payloads into space. 
	These far larger payload would have allowed for larger spacecraft. These larger spacecrafts could make travel nicer and allow for larger projects. Researchers believed they could visit the moon, mars and even 
	Jupiter.</p>
	<p>The system would have allowed for faster travel which is something that is always wanted in spaceflight due to its danger. Reduced times also reduced the physical effects on the body from
	lack of gravity and radiation exposure (from space). Reduced times means fewer supplies needed for travel further increasing the payload that the mission could have. </p>

			The cost of the program was estimated to be that roughly of the Apollo program but putting a lot more men on the moon.

	<h3>Death of the Program:</h3>
	<p>The program would eventually be cancelled not due to technical issues but due to politics and the environment. The test ban treaty would effectively stop the program from ever getting off the ground as it banned the detonation of nuclear weapons. There were also environmental concerns about detonating nuclear weapons in the upper atmosphere and the dispersal of fallout over a large area.
		These two reasons would lead to the program being shut down.
	</P>
	<br>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>The program while technologically possible and with high expectations and benefits like many similar projects was cancelled due to test ban treaty and environmental concerns. 
	Both of which in this case were valid as the treaty helped ease tension in the cold war and detonating nukes in the upper atmosphere would have led to serious environmental issues over a large area.</P>
	<p>It is however sad to think that we could today have had set up bases on the moon and started exploring the solar system, but I think very few people would fly in a rocket let alone one powered by nuclear bombs.</p>
