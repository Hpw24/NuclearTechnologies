	<p class="lead">Radioisotopes and radiation can provide a vital role as treatments and other diagnostics applications in medicine:</P>
	<br>
	<h3>Diagnostics</h3>
	<p>Radioisotopes can be used to diagnose medical ailments. They can be ingested by patients and will give off radiation inside the patient. 
	The isotope used for this must meet certain requirements so that it is safe for use. The isotope must not have a long half life as to minimize
	the patient’s exposure to the radiation.
	It must give of a radiation that can pass through the body so alpha cannot be used. </P>
	<br>
	<h3>Gene Manipulation:</h3>
	<p>They can also be used to create better and more resistant plants. Ionising radiation from gamma rays can be used to induce mutations in plants and this has the possibility to create useful genes in plants making
	them more productive or more resilient and therefor improving yields. This technique is very useful as it allows for the creation of genes that might not be found in nature or may have been lost to evolution.</P>
	<br>
	<h3>Preservation:</h3>
	<p>25-30% of the world’s food is lost to spoilage.  One way to reduce that is to irradiate food as this can kill bacteria and parasites. Irradiation has some advantages over traditional methods such as it
	uses less energy than refrigeration and reduces the need for preservatives and chemicals which are both harmful to workers and customers. One of the great uses of radiations Is with sealed foods as gamma rays
	can penetrate packaging killing bacteria but being sealed means it won’t be contaminated.</P>
