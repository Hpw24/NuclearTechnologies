			<h1 class="display-3">Fission Chain Reactions</h1>
			<p class="lead">A chain reaction is a simple concept but vital to getting use (Energy) through fission. 
			It is the mechanism by which both bombs and power plants operate and underpins most of nuclear technologies.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The reason a chain reaction is so important is because if you imagine the reactor as a campfire. 
		If I light a match it's like having fission occur in a single atom it's useless and quite a bit of effort for very little reward. However
		, if I was to take the match and light the campfire the fire becomes 
		self-sustaining (until it runs out of fuel at least) and then it becomes useful to me and I can get energy out of it. </p>
		
		<h2>The Process:</h2>
		<br>
		<p>A chain reaction can start with one single fission event. The event is usually induced by a neutron being absorbed by an atom causing it to become unstable and 
		undergo <a href="fission.html">fission </a>. Skipping over fission mostly this leads to a large release of energy as well as some neutrons. These neutrons can then go on to induce more fission events and so on. 
		Because after each event there are more neutrons more events occur, and the reaction becomes exponential as more and more events happen and neutrons are released.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Controlled Reactions:</h3>
		<p>Controlled chain reactions are found in power plants. Controlling a chain reaction and making sure that it doesn't become uncontrolled and explode is vitally important.
		It is also important that the chain reaction continues and doesn’t stop. </p>
		<p>Chain reactions are usually controlled by limiting the number of neutrons in the reactor via control mediums or control rods, in combination or in other ways. 
		This limiting of the number of neutrons allows plant operators to control whether the plant is Supercritical, subcritical or at criticality.</p>
		<br>
		<h5>What happens if the reaction in a reactor becomes uncontrolled?</h5>
		<p>This is first highly unlikely due to many safety features and will not result in an explosion like that of an atomic bomb due to the mass of the fuel not being critical.
		Instead what happens is that eventually what will happen is reaction will continue and more and more energy will be released. This will first lead to the melting of the fuel (if it is solid) 
		and perhaps the container and some of the fuel may escape. However, what happens is largely dependant on if any of the plant’s safety features work as well as the design of the plant.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Uncontrolled Reactions: </h3>
		<p>Uncontrolled reactions are mainly used in nuclear bombs and are generally not that useful for harnessing energy as there is usually an explosion and the energy is released in one 
		go. But mostly because we want to control the amount of energy we get out of reactions and we want to get the most out of it. One of the problems with nuclear bombs is that they tend to blow
		up before all the fuel has been used meaning that some energy has been wasted which obviously Is not what we want to happen.
		In a reactor because the reaction is slower and more controlled more energy can be extracted without waste. Uncontrolled reactions tend to be supercritical as you want to get energy out of
		them.</p>

					<td>The chain reaction is occurring, and more neutrons are being created than lost to control leading to more fission events. A reactor would be supercritical
					when it is starting up or increasing its power output.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr >
					<td>Subcriticality</td>
					<td>Not enough neutrons are made to sustain the number of fission events and so the number of these events therefor decreases as the chain reaction is no longer sustainable.

		<h2>Critical Mass:</h2>
		<p >The critical mass is the mass required of a fissile material to reach a sustained nuclear reaction (such as a chain reaction).
		The critical mass could be described as the amount of mass you need to tip some scales. 
		You keep adding on more and more mass until the scales eventually tip at the critical mass. </p>

		<table class="table">
			<thead class="thead-light">
				<tr>
					<th>Variable</th>
					<th></th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Nuclear fission cross section</td>
					<td>This is the probability that a fission reaction will occur. The higher the probability fission will occur the lower the critical mass.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Density</td>
					<td>The denser the fuel or material the more likely that a neutron will collide with a nucleus and therefor fission can occur. This means the denser the fuel the lower the critical mass.
					This factor is exploited in an implosion type bomb which compresses a subcritical piece of mass into a critical one. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Shape</td>
					<td>The shape of the material can affect how easily neutrons are absorbed based on the directions that move out in. The best shape is a sphere however this is not always possible or needed.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Purity</td>
					<td>The purer a fuel the more atoms that can undergo fission thus increasing purity decreases the critical mass.<a href="uranium2.html"> U-235</a> needs to be above 80% pure to be considered weapons grade but only between
					3-5% for reactors. For weapons this is because having a low critical mass means weapons can be small and thus integrated into delivery mechanisms (e.g. missiles). 
					Conversely powerplants do not have this restriction and having a low critical mass is in fact a issue as it makes the reaction harder to control.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Temperature</td>
					<td>Increasing the temperature increases how much atoms vibrate thus increasing the chance of a neutron collision this is very similar to how increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction
					in a normal chemical reaction.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Surroundings</td>
					<td>Depending on what materials encase the fuel and whether they are neutron absorbing or deflecting. Absorbing materials will reduce the number of neutrons available to cause 
					fission while a deflector will increase it by re-directing neutrons back towards nucleuses.</td>
