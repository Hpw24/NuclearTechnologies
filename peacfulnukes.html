	<p>Nuclear Weapons are simply a means to a very large explosion. The main benefits that they have over conventional weapons is that for their size 
	they simply release more energy. Gunpowder, dynamite and Tnt have all been used to wage war but their destructive power had also been used 
	in mining and in other civillian applications where an explosive force was needed. So at the beginning of the cold war both the USA and the USSR developed
	programs (Project Plowshare and Employment of Nuclear Explosive Technologies  in the Interests of National Economy respectively) to try and use the power of
	nuclear weapons and their benefits for civillian applications.</p>

		<h2>Project Plowshare:</h2>
		<p>Project Plowshare was the American program and ran from 1958 to 1975 with the goal of using what was deemed relatively inexpensive energy from nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes. 
		The project carried out 27 nuclear tests with a total of 35 detonations of nuclear devices. The devices ranged in power from 1kt up to 105kt. 
		Along with nuclear tests the program also conducted conventional tests with regular chemical explosives. 
		This was mainly done to determine the power they would need if they were to use a nuclear device instead.
		</p>
		<h3>Applications:</h3>
		<p>The project had two broad categories for the use of the explosive energy. The first was as an excavation tool and would use the energy to displace earth or rock much in the same way conventional explosives would but only on a larger scale with a large force. 
		The second was to improve natural resource extraction by using the nuclear explosion to stimulate natural gas. There were also some plans to detonate bombs as physics research.
		</p>
		<p>To quote the report of the project :
			<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
				<p class="text-monospace">canals, harbours, highway and railroad cuts through mountains, open pit mining, construction of dams, and other quarry and construction-related projects.</p>
				<footer class="blockquote-footer"><a href="https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf">Plowshare Program Report</a></footer>
				</blockquote>
		These proposed projects that nuclear weapons could be used for were mainly in the early stages of construction when large amount of earth or a large area had to be cleared.
		The scale of these proposed projects called for the use of nuclear weapons simply because conventional explosives didn’t have the power to cut through mountains.
		To be more specific it’s not chemical weapons “lack of power” stopping them from blowing up a mountain its more a question of practicality.
		It is possible to create a valley with say for example dynamite however the amount needed is astronomical compared to nuclear weapons. 
		None of the projects would ever be attempted on a large scale but the fact that this was a project that was investigated speaks volumes 
		about the optimism people had at the time and what plans people had to use nuclear technology to quite literally shape the world in a way we half a century later still cannot practically 
		accomplish.

				<tr>
					<td>Project Carryall</td>
					<td> A study about the feasibility of a plan to create a pass-through the mountains for both a highway and railway in the Bristol Mountains (California) using nuclear weapons. 
					The study was conducted with help from Atkinson, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroads as well as state and federal government agencies.</td>

					<td>Project Chariot</td>
					<td>Create a harbour by detonating a 100-kiloton bomb and then a series of 20kiloton bombs to connect it to the ocean in Alaska. 
					The project was held up by both environmental concerns and technical issues leading to studies  being conducted at the proposed site from 1959-1962 however the project never left these stages. </td>

				<tr>
					<td>Project Ditchdigger</td>
					<td> A plan to try and develop clean bombs so as to make it easier to construct canals</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Interoceanic sea-level canal study</td>
					<td>A study looking at constructing more canals to connect the Atlantic and the pacific as well as ecological impacts of using nuclear weapons to do so. 3-routes were studied with two being in Panama (where the USA had already built the Panama Canal)
					and one in Columbia (which Panama used to be a part of until the US wanted to build the Canal).
					The report stated that the US when making decisions on building canals should assume that they can't use nuclear explosions.</td>

		<h3>Conclusion to the program:</h3>
		<p>The program was terminated in 1975 with not much to show for the program. No programs went really beyond feasibility testing.
		None of the excavation took place and the program was not popular with the public as understandably they were worried mainly about the environmental and health impacts.
		The most promising outcome from the project was the natural gas stimulation technology. $82 million was in total invested but estimates placed the value of gas that could be extracted 
		at roughly $30 million at maximum. 
		This combined with new technologies for gas extraction such as fracking ultimately contributed to what can be considered the failure of the program to have any tangible benefits. 
		</p>
		<p>To conclude all the program did was blow up some nuclear weapons and normal bombs, perform many ecological surveys and waste quite a bit of money but we 
			now know that nuclear weapons can not be practically used for peaceful purposes.</P>

	<h2>Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy:</h2>
	<p> The Soviets in 1965 decided that now was the time to get into the business of using "Nuclear explosions for the national economy" and they had greater success than their American counterparts. 
	The program would begin in 1965 with the formation of a lake in Kazakhstan being the first of what would be 122 explosions. The program would investigate 13 of nuclear
	explosions and would go on to put 5 to use.
	The program would ultimately end with the cessation of testing nuclear Weapons in 1989. Its important to note that most of the program was hidden from the public up 
	until Glasnost in the late 80’s.</p>
	
	<h3>Soviet uses for nuclear explosives</h3>

			<tr>
				<th>Project Name</th>
				<th>Project summary</th
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Water-reservoir Construction</td>
				<td>The first project undertaken by the program was the creation of water reservoirs to alleviate water shortages.
				This was relatively a simple undertaking as it simply required the detonation of a nuke and then to fill the crater that was created.
				Multiple detonations took place over the life of the program with some reservoirs still in use today.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Kama-Pechora Canal Project</td>
				<td>The Kama-Pechora Canal project was a project to create a canal mirroring the US’s own plans, but instead of bridging oceans the canal would instead be used to divert water.
				The Caspian Sea in central Asia had been shrinking due to overuse and so a plan was devised to build a canal to refill the sea. Test detonations were conducting,
				and some proved unsuccessful with parts of the planned canal deemed “not appropriate for nuclear excavation”. The project would never break ground due 
				to the Limited Test Ban Treaty which the project would have violated and eventually due to environmental concerns from moving large amounts of water resulting in the plans being cancelled .  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Dam Construction</td>
				<td>In 1974 another excavation was performed in Siberia using Nuclear weapons creating an up-thrusting dome with hopefully a lake behind it.
				There is no information on the lake, but the mound was said to be 10m high. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Oil and Gas Stimulation</td>
				<td>
					<p>Like the Americans the soviets also investigated using nuclear weapons to improve natural gas production with two projects however only one has been reported named “Neva”. 
					This project involved six detonations from 13-16kt and a separate detonation which was assumed to be for storing waste products. They had a recovery rate “20 times normal” which indicates that they fared much better than the US’s similar projects.
					</p>
					<p>The Soviets also investigated using nuclear weapons to improve production of oil which resulted in an increase of 40-80% projected extraction of oil. 
					In total 5 projects were carried out in the stimulation of oil project.
					</p>

			<tr>
				<td>Cavity Technology development</td>
				<td>The Soviets investigated creating cavities under the earth with the project being codenamed “Halite”. The project conducted 3 explosions of size 1.1kt, 27kt and 64kt. 
				All 3 explosions successfully produced cavities however the first two filled with water and the first one resulted in the leak of radioactive gas.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Eliminating Gas well fires</td>
				<td>One of the more promising uses of nuclear weapons in a kind of ironic way is the extinguishing of gas fires putting the phrase<b> fight fire with fire</b> into the literal sense. 
				In the Urtabulak gas field in 1963 control of the well was loss and approximately 12billion litres of gas were lost per day. Conventional ways to control the fire and seal the
				well failed so on the 30th September 1966 a 30kt device was buried at a depth of 1500m and detonated extinguishing the fire and allowing the authorities to seal the well.
				A couple of years later nearby a 47kt device was used for the same purposes after which the technique would go on to be used on several other occasions.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cavities for underground storage</td>
				<td><p>Building on the success and failures of the earlier cavities experiments the decision was made to use the created areas as underground storage areas for natural gas.
				The first device (2.3kt) was detonated on the 25 June 1970 creating a storage area of 11000000 litres and filled with natural gas from a nearby source. 
				Overall there would be 3 large scale applications of the technology. 
				The technology is partially successful however there are concerns about how stable the cavities are and water leakages leading to environmental damage.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly the technology may have a use today. The creation of cavities could be used as part of a carbon capture and storage system used to mitigate climate
				change and pollution. These systems capture carbon dioxide and stores it underground usually in disused oil fields.
				Although the technology could be used it is unlikely to be implemented due to the unreliability of the cavities produced as well as the ban on nuclear tests.
				</P>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Deep Seismic Sounding</td>
				<td>Collaborating with the ministry of geology the soviet program decided to use nuclear weapons in deep seismic sounding. 
				This involved studying the geology of the Earths crust at large depths. They used nuclear weapons to produce much larger signals to study to deeper depths and over larger areas.
				This project used data from other nuclear explosion which were not done exclusively for this study as well as detonations used for this study.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ore Breakage</td>
				<td>One of the primary peaceful uses for nuclear explosions is clearing areas another use was to use the nuclear explosive to break up ores during in mining.
				Two experiments took place on the Kola peninsula in a mine and the project never went beyond testing.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Toxic  Waste Disposal</td>
				<td>Once again using the cavity technology the Soviet Union decided to create areas underground for storage but instead of gas this time toxic waste would be stored.
				First cavity was created in 1973 and later utilised in 1976 being filled with waste from a soda factory.
				A second storage site was created and stored refinery waste. Despite being successfully applied the technology would not see further use.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Heavy Element Production</td>
				<td>During nuclear explosions there are many neutrons created and both the US and USSR sought to harness these neutrons to make heavier elements and isotopes.
				The created material could then be extracted for use. Sadly, there is little information on the results of the experiments  regarding  product creation.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Decoupling Experiment</td>
				<td>The decoupling experiment was an experiment to test the concept of decoupling. The theory is that if you were to detonate a nuclear weapon in a cavity the seismic signal 
				from the explosion would be greatly dampened. 
				The experiment showed that this was the case.</td>

	<h2>Overall Conclusion:</h2>
	<p>To conclude the soviet program was more successful than the US as their program developed techniques and project which were used and had an effect which their counterparts did not. 
	However, it is plain to see why the programs did not take off and that is the environmental issues. 
	Public opinion was against detonating nuclear weapons and rightfully so as the soviet program had a litany of events where radiation escaped, or a cavity was flooded. </p>
	<p>However, the final nails in the coffin for these programs would be public opinion and the test ban treaties which prohibited nuclear tests.
	The programs were aspirational and idealistic but with the benefit of hindsight a misguided effort into something that people didn’t want and wasn’t necessary.</p>
