	<p class="lead">Radioisotopes and radiation can provide a boosting role in agriculture helping to boost production and reduce waste.</P>
	<br>
	<h3>Pest Control:</h3>
	<p>One-way radioisotopes can be used is to reduce the number of pests. To control pests’ farmers often use pesticides which can have environmental side effects. 
	Radiolabels can help monitor pesticides and their persistence as they are used as a kind of tag applied to the pesticide. This helps farmers know where pesticides 
	are and how strong they are as they can easily measure radiation levels to do so. This helps reduce the side effects of pesticides.</P>
	<p>There is also a technique called SIT. This technique involves sterilising a large portion of male insects that are pests using radiation. These males are then released into the target 
	area and will compete with non-sterilised males to mate with females. This reduces the population drastically over a few generations. The technique is good because
	it is environmentally friendly as it doesn’t require chemicals, uses non-invasive native species, is target to a specific species and the sterilised population die out and don’t contaminate the ecosystem. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Gene Manipulation:</h3>
	<p>They can also be used to create better and more resistant plants. Ionising radiation from gamma rays can be used to induce mutations in plants and this has the possibility to create useful genes in plants making
	them more productive or more resilient and therefor improving yields. This technique is very useful as it allows for the creation of genes that might not be found in nature or may have been lost to evolution.</P>
	<br>
	<h3>Preservation:</h3>
	<p>25-30% of the world’s food is lost to spoilage.  One way to reduce that is to irradiate food as this can kill bacteria and parasites. Irradiation has some advantages over traditional methods such as it
	uses less energy than refrigeration and reduces the need for preservatives and chemicals which are both harmful to workers and customers. One of the great uses of radiations Is with sealed foods as gamma rays
	can penetrate packaging killing bacteria but being sealed means it won’t be contaminated.</P>
