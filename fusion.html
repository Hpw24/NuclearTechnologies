		<h1 class="display-3">Nuclear Fusion</h1>
		<p class="lead">The definition of nuclear fusion is a reaction where two large atomic nuclei are fused together to create a larger nucleus and energy is released in the process.</p>
	</div>
	<h3>The Process:</h3>
	<p class="lead">The process of nuclear fusion is simple and easier to understand than fission.</p>
	<p>The two nuclei must be brought together which is where the main problem occurs as each nucleus is positively charged, they will repel each other. To overcome this the material which is to be
	fused together must be heated to a very high temperature probably turning into plasma. Once its hot enough the particles will be travelling fast enough to overcome the repulsive force. 
	Temperature must usually be in excess of 150,000,000 degrees Celsius. Once collided the strong nuclear force will hold together the new nucleus and some of the mass will be converted into energy.</p>
	<h3>Stars</h3>
	<p>Stars are often referred to as a ball of burning gas which is false as what they are doing is undergoing nuclear fusion which is a much more efficient way to extract energy. Fusion is what drives 
	stars and keeps them from collapsing in on themselves. The pressure of fusion acts as a force outward preventing the star from collapsing. Most stars fuse hydrogen into helium (proton-proton fusion) 
	but later in their life and large stars can synthesise heavier elements. It is estimated that the sun releases 3.8*10^26 joules of energy every second from fusion.</P>
