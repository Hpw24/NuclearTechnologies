	<br>
	<p>Fusion reactors are still being researched. There are currently operational reactors, but they could never be used as powerplants at the moment. This is because they require more energy to operate
	than the give out but scientist are hopeful that they can make them more efficient so we can start benefiting from them. The main reason they are so inefficient is that the process needs temperature
	in excess of 100 million degrees centigrade.</p>
	<h3>Current Design Ideas:</h3>

		  <h4 class="card-title">Inertial Confinement:</h4>
		  <p class="card-text">In this design a pellet of fuel about the size of a pea is compressed by lasers or ion beams to an incredibly high density. Once at this high density the pellet is then ignited
		  using shock wave heating. This process is repeated multiple times per second to create enough energy to boil water and drive a turbine like a conventional power plant.</p>

		  <h4 class="card-title">Magnetic Confinement:</h4>
		  <p class="card-text">Powerful electromagnets use magnetic fields to contain plasma fuel. Then a large current of electricity is induced in the plasma causing heating so that the fuel can undergo fusion.
		  Usually there are other methods such as microwaves which are used to further heat the fuel so it can undergo fusion. The heat would once again be used to drive a turbine.</p>

	<h3>Fuel:</h3>
	<p>The fuel used in both reactors would be a combination of Deuterium and Tritium which are both isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium can be found in small quantities naturally in sea water which it can rather economically 
	be extracted from while Tritium can be made from the common element Lithium. It has been estimated that in one litre of seawater contains enough Deuterium and therefor the potential to be turned into energy as 300 
	litres of oil undergoing combustion. This is why a fusion reactor would have a near limitless supply of water due to the Earths huge oceans.</p>
	<h3>Safety:</h3>
	<p>Fusion reactors are much safer than normal nuclear reactors since the reaction is so hard to engineer and is all done artificially. Fission reactors need chain reactions which can get out of hand without 
	human intervention 
	while Fusion reactions donâ€™t have this. They need to be kept at high temperatures so that the reaction takes place meaning that its very easy to stop it if something goes wrong.  </p>
	<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
	<p>Fusion reactors if they could be got to work could be a utopian like technology. Bringing clean almost limitless energy to the world but unfortunately, they may never be made efficient enough to work. However, on 
	the Brightside it is a developing technology and one day they may light up the world.</P>
