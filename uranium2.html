	<p>Uranium is a widely know along with plutonium as a nuclear fuel used both in weapons and reactors. 
	It has 92 protons and was discovered in 1789 by Martin Heinrich Klaproth. Current world production or uranium is estimated to be 41,000 tons.</P>

	<p>Uranium has two naturally occurring isotopes U-235 and U-238. They are found in the ratio of 1:99 which is a problem. 
	While both isotopes are fissionable only U-235 is fissile meaning that it can undergo fission via a low kinetic energy neutron. Due to this problem it must be enriched
	from natural levels depending on its purpose.
	For reactors it is enriched to somewhere between 3% and 5% while for weapons it will be enriched to a minimum of 80%.  </P>
	<p>An important Uranium chemical is Uranium Hexafluoride which is used to enrich the Uranium in the only two commercially viable methods which
	are the gaseous diffusion process and centrifuge process. Both methods make use of the difference in mass between the isotopes. In the centrifuge method the gas is
	fed into a centrifuge which then spins forcing the heaving molecules(U-238) to the edges and the light molecules to the centre where they are then collected. 
	Diffusion is not used any more due to it being very energy intensive. The highest concentration that the US can produce of U-235 is 97.5%.</p>
	<p>Just because U-238 is not fissile does not mean it can’t be involved in the generation of electricity. When U-238 absorbs neutrons, it will sometimes decay into plutonium-239
	which is fissile meaning that in a nuclear reactor with uranium fuel a portion of the energy is in fact coming from Plutonium.
	This is in fact how Plutonium is made.</p>
	
	<h3 id="depletedu">Depleted Uranium:</h3>
	<p>Due to enrichment a by-product called depleted uranium is created. As the U-238 and U-235 are separated a large amount of uranium is left made up of mainly U-238 but with a
	much smaller portion of U-235 usually around 0.3%. Due to this it is less radioactive than normal uranium.</p>
	<p>This by-product has uses though such as being mixed in with enriched weapons grade Uranium to make reactor grade uranium. This is primarily to due to arms reduction treaties and is a 
	good way to make use of the weapons fuel although this process is not used any more as most excess weapons grade uranium has been used up. Other uses mainly utilise its density which is a very
	attractive attribute for both the military and 
	civilian use where it can be used for control surfaces such as aircraft. It’s also used in armour piercing rounds and saw use mainly in the gulf wars.  </p>
