	<h1 class="display-3">Plutonium</h1>
	<p>Plutonium is the second most prominent nuclear fuel and entirely artificial. Despite being perhaps 
	slightly less well known than Uranium it was used in the trinity test by the Manhattan project and signalled the
	opening of the atomic age. The element was discovered in 1940 by Glenn Seaborg and his colleagues and gets its name from the dwarf planet Pluto. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Creation</h3>
	<p>Plutonium is heavier than Uranium with 94 protons compared to 92 meaning that it cannot be found on Earth naturally (as uranium is the heaviest occurring element).
	It is instead made in nuclear reactors with the first ones being made not to provide power but to instead create Plutonium for use in war. It is created by bombarding U-238 
	(the more common Uranium isotope) with neutrons causing the following decays to occur.</p>
	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		<p class="text-monospace">U-238 + Neutron --> U-239<br>
		U-239 -(Beta Decay)-> Np-239 + β<sup>-</sup><br>
		Np-239 -(Beta Decay)-> Pu-239 + β<sup>-</sup><br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Important Isotopes</h3>
	<h5>Pu-239:</h5>
	<p>Pu-239 is the most common isotope and desired for both bombs and reactors. It does however emit a lot of radiation (1.92 watts per kg) meaning that it can heat up if insulated properly at a reasonable rate. 
	This needs to be considered when using the fuel as heat can weaken the structural integrity of weapons or cause issues.</p>
	<h5 id ="240">Pu-240</h5>
	<p>Continuing along the subject of weapons Pu-240 is seen as a contaminant when it comes to Plutonium being used as a fuel for nuclear weapons. 
	The problem with 240 is that it undergoes spontaneous fission and releases a lot of neutrons. This can cause issues in nuclear weapons causing them to pre-detonate 
	leading to a loss in explosive power. 240 is the reason that Plutonium requires <a href="basicweapondesign.html">implosion</a> type design to overcome these issues. To be considered weapons grade plutonium must contain below 6.5% of Pu-240</p>
	<h5>Pu-238</h5>
	<p>Pu-238 can be made by bombarding Neptunium-237 in breeder reactors when large amount is required. The reason large amounts of 238 may be required is because
	it is a primary fuel in <a href="rtg.html">RTGs</a> due to the large amount of heat it gives off via radioactive decay.</p>
