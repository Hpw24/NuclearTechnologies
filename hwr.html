	<p class="lead">Heavy water reactors are very similar to there light water counterparts apart from the fact that they use heavy water. 
	The reactor uses heavy water as both coolant and moderator much in the same fashion as <a href="lwr.html">Pressurised Light Water reactors</a>.</p>
	<h3>Heavy Water (Deuterium):</h3>
	<p>Heavy water gets its name from the fact that it is heavier than normal water. The reason it is heavier is because unlike normal water which is made 
	up of Hydrogen and Oxygen, heavy water is made up of Deuterium and oxygen. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen with one extra neutron than normal. Its main
	difference is that it absorbs less neutrons than normal hydrogen meaning more neutrons are available for fission.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Pros:</h4>
	<ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">Heavy water reactors can work with many fuels including un-enriched natural uranium. This is a huge benefit as it reduces costs dramatically for fuel.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">They also can be refuelled during operation meaning that they can continuously operate.</li>
		
	</ul>
	<h4>Cons:</h4>
	<ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">They produce Tritium which is radioactive and know to leak out in small quantities.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">They can be modified to produce more weapons grade plutonium than normal reactors would.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Heavy Water reactors have a great advantage over their light water counterparts in the fact that they donâ€™t need to be enriched reducing costs and waste products
	as no <a href="uranium2.html#depletedu">depleted uranium</a> is created. This combined with their flexibility with other fuels makes them like the pig of reactors. The fact that they can produce more weapons
	grade plutonium is not a good thing as it contributes to nuclear proliferation and goes against the reduction of the number of nuclear weapons. However, the benefits created 
	from the fuel flexibility and the fact that the reactor has to be modified makes the heavy water reactor a big step up from light water reactors.</p>
