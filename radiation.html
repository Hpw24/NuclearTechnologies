	<p>This is a rather broad definition and includes things that are not within the scope of this website such as the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
	We will instead be focusing on Nuclear radiation which is radiation that simply originates from the nucleus of which there are 4 main types that you will need to know about.</P>

			<div class="card-header">
				Alpha (α)
			</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				Alpha radiations composition is relatively simple in that it is a Helium atom with no electrons (2 protons and 2 neutrons).
				It is the largest radiation based on size and has the most ionizing capability with 10,000 ionisations per mm of air. It is however stopped by a few cm of air or paper and travels slowly.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<div class="card-header">
				Beta- (β<sup>-</sup>)
			</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				Beta – radiation is simply composed of an electron and compared to Alpha is much weaker when it comes to ionisation only ionising about 100
				atoms per mm compared to Alphas thousands. It does however travel faster and has much greater penetration needing aluminium roughly 3mm thick to stop it.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<div class="card-header">
				Beta+ (β<sup>+</sup>)
			</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<p>Beta + radiation is very similar to Beta minus but instead involves a positron which is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. This means that if it comes in to contact with 
				an electron it will annihilate itself and the electron. Annihilation occurs almost instantaneously meaning that it does very little ionisation. </p>
				<p>We can calculate the amount of energy released in an annihilation using E=MC^2:</p>
				<p>=(2*mass of electrons)*(speed of light)<sup>2</sup>  Joules </p>
				<p>=(2*9.109*10<sup>-31</sup>)*(3.00*10<sup>8</sup>)<sup>2</sup> =1.64*10<sup>-13</sup> Joules</P>

				Gamma γ
			</div>
			<div class="card-body">
			Gamma unlike the other types of radiation is an electromagnetic wave. This mean that it travels at the speed of light and can penetrate very deeply up 
			to meters of concrete of centimetres of lead. However, it has very low ionisation even lower than Beta-.

			<div class="card-header">
				Electron Capture
			</div>
			<div class="card-body">
			While worth mentioning electron capture is not too important to know about. It occurs when an electron is absorbed by the nucleus turning
			a proton into a neutron. This results in the release of an x-ray followed by some gamma rays from the nucleus.
