			<p>Pressurised water reactors are the most common nuclear reactors. They use water as both a coolant and a 
			moderator however the coolant water is separated from the water that is turned into steam and heats it in a heat exchange. </p>
			<h5>Pros:</h5>
			
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">The secondary loop for water to be turned into steam makes maintenance easier as radiation is contained to the core reactor.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">The pressurised water reactor has a compact design which makes it perfect for naval applications and has been used on aircraft carriers.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">The design has been around for a long time meaning that it has a good safety record and it can be optimised to get the most power output.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h5>Cons:</h5>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">The reactor design does not allow the breeding of new isotopes and elements meaning that it cannot create new fuel. </li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Coolant is kept at high pressure meaning that if there is a leak lots of it can escape quickly meaning that a lot of investment needs to be made into redundant coolant systems.</li>

			<p>Boiling water reactors are the second most common reactors and use water as both a coolant and moderator. There main deviation from pressurised water reactors is there lack of secondary loop.
			They do not have a heat transfer between the coolant and water from elsewhere. Instead coolant is converted into steam and sent from the reactor straight to the turbine.</p>
			<h5>Pros:</h5>
			
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">The main advantage to this design is that it has a much simpler design as there is no need for a heat transfer simplifying the implementation of the design.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h5>Cons:</h5>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">Like the pressurised water reactor, it canâ€™t breed fuel or new isotopes and elements. </li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Due to its design water coming from the reactor travels straight to the turbine. This poses this issue of radiation as it is no longer contained
				and increases the possible areas it can be found in. This makes maintenance a bigger issue as precautions now need to be taken in more areas than a pressurised water reactor.</li>
