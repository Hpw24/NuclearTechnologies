			<p class ="lead">There are many different types of reactors and designs using different fuels and serving different purposes.
			Here we will take the reactor into a more abstract view and focus on the core components so it is easier to see the differences between actual reactor designs.</P>
		</div>
		
			
		
		<p>The reactor generates electricity by harvesting the heat from the nuclear fission reactor in the core. The coolant is used to cool the
		reactor and in-turn is heated up. It is then passed into a heat exchange where it boils water. The steam is then passed into a turbine like a conventional 
		power plant turning a generator creating electricity. The steam will then be cooled in the large cooling towers which is the stereotypical image of a nuclear power 
		plant and can be seen with steam coming out of them. Due to needing large amount of water nuclear power plants are usually located next to large sources of water such as the ocean.</p>

				<p>This is a diagram for a Magnox reactor, but it contains the components of a traditional reactor but removing the parts of the turbine and cooling towers.</p>
				<p>The key will explain what each part is and its role to play in the reactor however some parts are omitted as they go into too much detail and are not needed for our abstraction.</p>
