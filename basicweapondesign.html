	<p class="text-muted">The gun and implosion-type bombs were the first generation of bombs with each being used against Japan at the end of the second world war. Both designs rely 100% on fission
	unlike more advanced designs.The principles behind both bombs are pretty simple turning subcritical masses of Uranium or Plutonium into supercritical masses causing a chain reaction and then an explosion.</p>

			<h3 class="card-header">Gun-Type</h3>
			<p class="card-text">
			Two subcritical pieces of material are kept apart. When the bomb is activated one of the subcritical pieces is fired towards another subcritical pieces of fuel. 
			This creates a supercritical mass which then has neutrons fired at it which causes a fast chain reaction. The chain reaction will spread quickly through the material releasing lots of energy
			as an explosion.</p>

			<h3 class="card-header">Implosion-Type</h3>
			<p class="card-text">
			Implosion type is  a sphere of subcritical mass surrounded by other pieces of subcritical mass and explosives.
			A sphere is used as this is the best shape as neutrons are more likely to collide with another nucleus.
			When detonated the explosives compress the subcritical mass into a supercritical mass leading to a chain reaction as fission occurs eventually resulting in an explosion.</p>

	<h1 class="display-4">Pros and cons of the designs:</h1>
	<p>An implosion type bomb is much harder to design and implement than a gun type bomb as the mechanism require more precise calculations for the explosives to create a critical mass compared to a gun type device. This is because to create a gun type bomb its relatively simple all you need to calculate a supercritical mass and then split it into two subcritical masses. </p>
		<p>The activation method is also simpler for the gun as all you need is really an explosive or a mechanism to accelerate one mass into another which is not very hard as well as a neutron source. Compared to an implosion type where there are many subcritical pieces of fuel and explosives must be used. Theses explosives must be timed to work in synch so that the bomb functions normally.</p>
		<p>A gun type bombs simplicity also makes it easier to maintain as the firing mechanism is relatively simple compared to an implosion type bomb. This simplicity means that maintain or retrofitting the bomb is much easier as well as disarmament as you simply remove one of the pieces. The lack of pieces also reduces the chance of a fault compared to an implosion type bomb. Implosion type bombs are usually encased in a sphere and are sealed making Maintenance hard to do. The multiple explosive devices and there triggers also increase the chance of a failure as if one fails to detonate the implosion wonâ€™t work effectively or not at all.</p>
		<p>Implosion type bombs are also more robust when it comes to physical processes. This is because if the two subcritical pieces in a gun become misaligned or miss each other the reaction won't start. These types of misalignments come down to physical forces acting upon the bomb</p>
		<p>The main difference between them is that uranium won't work in an implosion type bomb (for complex reasons) and so these types of bombs instead use plutonium.</p>
